Instagram Mini Clone

A mini Instagram-style web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.
This project demonstrates backend development skills, database relationships, authentication, and frontend-backend integration.

-Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simplified Instagram-like system that supports:

User authentication

Following users

Creating posts

Liking and commenting on posts

Viewing a personalized feed

This project was developed as part of a mini project assignment to test backend logic, database design, and full-stack integration.

-Features
   -User Authentication

User signup

User login

Password hashing using bcrypt

JWT-based authentication for protected routes

  -Follow System

Users can follow other users

Users can unfollow users

Proper follower and following relationships are maintained

   -Post Creation

Authenticated users can create posts

Each post contains:

Image URL

Caption

 -Likes

Users can like a post

Users cannot like the same post more than once

Like count updates correctly

 -Comments

Users can comment on posts

Each comment stores:

Comment text

User who commented

Timestamp

 -Feed

Feed API returns posts only from users the logged-in user follows

Mimics real Instagram feed behavior

 -Tech Stack
1. Backend

2. Node.js

3. Express.js

4. MongoDB Atlas

git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd instagram-mini

2 Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install


Create a .env file inside the backend folder and add:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key


Start the backend server:

node server.js


Expected output:

Server running on port 5000
MongoDB Connected

3 Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Open the application in your browser:

http://localhost:5173

  -Testing

All backend APIs were tested using Postman

Frontend functionality tested manually:

Signup and Login

Create Post

Like and Comment

Feed updates based on follow/unfollow logic

 -Project Highlights
